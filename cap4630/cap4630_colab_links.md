Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) homework. 

In retrospect, the LSTM portion would have been better implemented using TensorFlow and Keras than PyTorch; PyTorch was used because PyTorch was purportedly more popular in industry at the time. Students who wrote their models in Keras attained better accuracy with fewer lines of code, which makes sense considering the sentiment analysis dataset was developed for Keras.

The number of correct training predictions for it extremely slowly tended upward. The training and testing accuracies remained essentially the same throughout.
